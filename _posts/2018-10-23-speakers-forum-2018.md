## “Innovation and Creative Leadership” by Dr. Edmund Lee

The Rev. Brother Paul Sun Education Foundation Speakers’ Forum is a series of charity fund-raising events featuring a substantial keynote guest speaker on each occasion. Speakers’ Forum 2018 took place on the evening of October 23, 2018 at the City Top of City University of Hong Kong. The speaker this time was Dr. Edmund Lee, Executive Director of Hong Kong Design Centre.

Dr. Lee, a Josephian, gave a talk on the topic of “Innovation and Creative Leadership.”

He highlighted the evolving qualities required of future leaders. He gave valuable insight into the human-centered service design mindset that is needed to address societal challenges and foster peace and humanity.

Dr. Lee emphasized on what is called “creative design confidence” that strengthens leadership and prepares us to better deal with the future’s complexity and uncertainty; it is a human-centered approach that can integrate the needs of the people, the endless possibilities of new technologies, and the requirements of business in order to bring about success and better results. Various examples were used to demonstrate the impact of creative design thinking including local facilities such as the Columbarium and Garden of Remembrance (Fanling), the Cornwall Street Park, and the Mong Kok Post Office.

More than 60 guests were very much inspired by Dr. Lee, including teachers and students. A questions and answers session followed. It was a most enjoyable evening for all.

To cap it off, a good sum of donation was raised, making yet another success in the series.
