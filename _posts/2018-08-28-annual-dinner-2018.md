## An enjoyable evening with our donors

The Rev. Brother Paul Sun Education Foundation held its Annual Dinner on 28th August 2018 at The Chinese Club in Central.  We were delighted to have with us on this occasion, as Guest of Honor, the newly appointed Vice-Chancellor and President of the Chinese University of Hong Kong Prof. Rocky S. Tuan, an alumnus of St. Joseph’s Anglo-Chinese School. The dinner was attended by over 80 guests including principals of the Foundation’s beneficiary schools, trustees, patrons, Josephians and supporters.

The Foundation’s Chairman, William Hui, gave a welcome speech and a brief report on the Foundation’s work. This was followed by a warm address by Prof. Tuan. Three awardees of the Rev. Bro. Paul Sun Young Scholar Scheme and the Primary School Scheme expressed their gratitude and thoughts on this occasion.  Principal Poon was also invited to share with all present recent news and upcoming plans for St. Joseph’s Anglo-Chinese School. Thank you for your participation and sharing with us an enjoyable evening.
