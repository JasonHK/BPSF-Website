Rev. Brother Paul Sun Education Foundation Annual Dinner was held on 18 July 2019 at Chinese Club. A full house of guests enjoyed the evening.

The Chairman gave a welcoming speech and a brief report on the Foundationâ€™s work over the past year. In gist, the Foundation had expanded its scheme to the Education University of Hong Kong, gained support from the Environmental Protection Department to organise experience field trips to our beneficiary schools, supported the improvement of facilities at SJACS and established emergency funds for our beneficiary schools. 

Various scholarship awardees expressed gratitude towards the donors of the Foundation and shared how to make good use of the subsidies. It was the best way to prove every cent of your donation was going to students directly. 

Last but not least, the Foundation was grateful of the support from participants and we raised over a hundred thousand of donation in the evening. We also thank you Ng Man Kin for his contribution of dinner costs and Andrew Li for wine. We seek for your continuous support.
