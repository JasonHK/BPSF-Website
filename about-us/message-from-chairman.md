It is my great honour to serve as the chairman of the Rev. Brother Paul Sun Education Foundation. The Foundation has been promoting excellence in local education for a decade since 2009, to continue the spirit and love of the Founder of SJACS and SJACPS, our beloved Bro. Paul Sun.

All trustees of the Foundation are working on a pro bono basis and no paid staff is engaged. It is my heartfelt gratitude to our honourary advisors, auditor, legal advisor, trustees, and all contributing parties. The Foundation will continue to maintain this absolute zero administrative cost practice and make sure every cent of the donation goes to students.

I invite you to browse our website and to learn more about our mission, history, fundraising events, and the scholarships and financial assistance programme we provide to students via our partnership with local schools.

Last but not least, on behalf of the Foundation, I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to all regular donors. With your generosity, more students would be able to benefit from our programmes.

Dr. Lewis NAM,
Chairman
